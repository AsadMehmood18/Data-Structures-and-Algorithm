## Project Description
This project aims to provide a comprehensive menu-driven implementation of various data structures and algorithms. The project includes functionalities for linked lists (singly, doubly, circular), stack, queue, tree, shortest path algorithms, and sorting algorithms. Each section of the project demonstrates the implementation and usage of these fundamental data structures and algorithms.

##linked list
###SinglyLinkedList
A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

###DoublyLinkedList
A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but each node contains an additional reference to the previous node, allowing for traversal in both directions. This makes certain operations more efficient.

###CircularLinkedList
In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure. This can be useful for implementing certain types of queues or buffers.

###LinkedListMenu
The linked list menu provides options to create and manipulate the different types of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular). It allows for adding, deleting, and displaying elements.

##Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This section includes operations such as push (adding an element), pop (removing the top element), and peek (viewing the top element without removing it).

##Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This section includes operations such as enqueue (adding an element to the end), dequeue (removing the front element), and peek (viewing the front element without removing it).

##Tree
A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root and remaining nodes as children of the root or its descendants. This section includes implementation of various types of trees (e.g., binary tree, binary search tree) and common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

##Shortest Path
This section covers algorithms for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Common algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* algorithm.

##Sorting Algorithm
Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). This section includes implementations of various sorting algorithms, such as bubble sort, quick sort, merge sort, and insertion sort.

##Main Menu
The main menu provides a central interface to access all the features of the project. It allows users to navigate to the different sections (linked lists, stack, queue, tree, shortest path, sorting algorithms) and perform the desired operations.
